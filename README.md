# Fizzbuzz

Fizzbuzz is a classic programming practice task in which a number divisible by three is replaced with "fizz", a number divisible by five is replaced by "buzz", and when a number is divisible by three and five, it is replaced with "fizzbuzz".

Although the task shown in the repository is more focused around starting to understand Rspec, a testing software used with the Ruby programming language. Rspec is the testing software that we used at Makers Academy to ensure that we work in a Test Driven Environment.

If you want to see this in action, grab a local copy of the repository and run the following commands.

```
# get the latest version of ruby
; rvm get stable
; rvm use ruby --latest --install --default

# Next, install bundler, which manages dependencies like RSpec
; gem install bundler

# Create a bundler project
; bundle init

# And add RSpec to your dependencies
; bundle add rspec

# to test this
; rspec
```
